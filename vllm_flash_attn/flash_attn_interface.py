    Supports multi-query and grouped-query attention (MQA/GQA) by passing in K, V with fewer heads
    than Q. Note that the number of heads in Q must be divisible by the number of heads in KV.
    For example, if Q has 6 heads and K, V have 2 heads, head 0, 1, 2 of Q will attention to head
    0 of K, V, and head 3, 4, 5 of Q will attention to head 1 of K, V.

        1 1 1 1 0
        1 1 1 1 1

    If k and v are not None, k_cache and v_cache will be updated *inplace* with the new values from
    k and v. This is useful for incremental decoding: you can pass in the cached keys/values from
    the previous step, and update them with the new keys/values from the current step, and do
    attention with the updated cache, all in 1 kernel.

    If you pass in k / v, you must make sure that the cache is large enough to hold the new values.
    For example, the KV cache could be pre-allocated with the max sequence length, and you can use
    cache_seqlens to keep track of the current sequence lengths of each sequence in the batch.

    Also apply rotary embedding if rotary_cos and rotary_sin are passed in. The key @k will be
    rotated by rotary_cos and rotary_sin at indices cache_seqlens, cache_seqlens + 1, etc.
    If causal or local (i.e., window_size != (-1, -1)), the query @q will be rotated by rotary_cos
    and rotary_sin at indices cache_seqlens, cache_seqlens + 1, etc.
    If not causal and not local, the query @q will be rotated by rotary_cos and rotary_sin at
    indices cache_seqlens only (i.e. we consider all tokens in @q to be at position cache_seqlens).

    See tests/test_flash_attn.py::test_flash_attn_kvcache for examples of how to use this function.

    Supports multi-query and grouped-query attention (MQA/GQA) by passing in KV with fewer heads
    than Q. Note that the number of heads in Q must be divisible by the number of heads in KV.
    For example, if Q has 6 heads and K, V have 2 heads, head 0, 1, 2 of Q will attention to head
    0 of K, V, and head 3, 4, 5 of Q will attention to head 1 of K, V.

    If causal=True, the causal mask is aligned to the bottom right corner of the attention matrix.
    For example, if seqlen_q = 2 and seqlen_k = 5, the causal mask (1 = keep, 0 = masked out) is:
        1 1 1 1 0
        1 1 1 1 1

        0 0
        1 0
