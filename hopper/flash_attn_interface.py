    If Q, K, V are already stacked into 1 tensor, this function will be faster than
    calling flash_attn_func on Q, K, V since the backward pass avoids explicit concatenation
    of the gradients of Q, K, V.
    For multi-query and grouped-query attention (MQA/GQA), please see
    flash_attn_kvpacked_func and flash_attn_func.

    If window_size != (-1, -1), implements sliding window local attention. Query at position i
    will only attend to keys between [i - window_size[0], i + window_size[1]] inclusive.

    Arguments:
        qkv: (batch_size, seqlen, 3, nheads, headdim)
        dropout_p: float. Dropout probability.
        softmax_scale: float. The scaling of QK^T before applying softmax.
            Default to 1 / sqrt(headdim).
        causal: bool. Whether to apply causal attention mask (e.g., for auto-regressive modeling).
        window_size: (left, right). If not (-1, -1), implements sliding window local attention.
        softcap: float. Anything > 0 activates softcapping attention.
        alibi_slopes: (nheads,) or (batch_size, nheads), fp32. A bias of (-alibi_slope * |i - j|) is added to
            the attention score of query i and key j.
        deterministic: bool. Whether to use the deterministic implementation of the backward pass,
            which is slightly slower and uses more memory. The forward pass is always deterministic.
        return_attn_probs: bool. Whether to return the attention probabilities. This option is for
           testing only. The returned probabilities are not guaranteed to be correct
           (they might not have the right scaling).
    Return:
        out: (batch_size, seqlen, nheads, headdim).
        softmax_lse [optional, if return_attn_probs=True]: (batch_size, nheads, seqlen). The
            logsumexp of each row of the matrix QK^T * scaling (e.g., log of the softmax
            normalization factor).
        S_dmask [optional, if return_attn_probs=True]: (batch_size, nheads, seqlen, seqlen).
            The output of softmax (possibly with different scaling). It also encodes the dropout
            pattern (negative means that location was dropped, nonnegative means it was kept).

    """dropout_p should be set to 0.0 during evaluation
    Supports multi-query and grouped-query attention (MQA/GQA) by passing in KV with fewer heads
    than Q. Note that the number of heads in Q must be divisible by the number of heads in KV.
    For example, if Q has 6 heads and K, V have 2 heads, head 0, 1, 2 of Q will attention to head
    0 of K, V, and head 3, 4, 5 of Q will attention to head 1 of K, V.

    If causal=True, the causal mask is aligned to the bottom right corner of the attention matrix.
    For example, if seqlen_q = 2 and seqlen_k = 5, the causal mask (1 = keep, 0 = masked out) is:
        1 1 1 1 0
        1 1 1 1 1
    If seqlen_q = 5 and seqlen_k = 2, the causal mask is:
        0 0
        0 0
        0 0
        1 0
        1 1
    If the row of the mask is all zero, the output will be zero.

    If window_size != (-1, -1), implements sliding window local attention. Query at position i
    will only attend to keys between
    [i + seqlen_k - seqlen_q - window_size[0], i + seqlen_k - seqlen_q + window_size[1]] inclusive.

    Arguments:
        q: (batch_size, seqlen, nheads, headdim)
        k: (batch_size, seqlen, nheads_k, headdim)
        v: (batch_size, seqlen, nheads_k, headdim)
        dropout_p: float. Dropout probability.
        softmax_scale: float. The scaling of QK^T before applying softmax.
            Default to 1 / sqrt(headdim).
        causal: bool. Whether to apply causal attention mask (e.g., for auto-regressive modeling).
        window_size: (left, right). If not (-1, -1), implements sliding window local attention.
        alibi_slopes: (nheads,) or (batch_size, nheads), fp32. A bias of
            (-alibi_slope * |i + seqlen_k - seqlen_q - j|)
            is added to the attention score of query i and key j.
        deterministic: bool. Whether to use the deterministic implementation of the backward pass,
            which is slightly slower and uses more memory. The forward pass is always deterministic.
        return_attn_probs: bool. Whether to return the attention probabilities. This option is for
           testing only. The returned probabilities are not guaranteed to be correct
           (they might not have the right scaling).
    Return:
        out: (batch_size, seqlen, nheads, headdim).
        softmax_lse [optional, if return_attn_probs=True]: (batch_size, nheads, seqlen). The
            logsumexp of each row of the matrix QK^T * scaling (e.g., log of the softmax
            normalization factor).

    If k and v are not None, k_cache and v_cache will be updated *inplace* with the new values from
    k and v. This is useful for incremental decoding: you can pass in the cached keys/values from
    the previous step, and update them with the new keys/values from the current step, and do
    attention with the updated cache, all in 1 kernel.

    If you pass in k / v, you must make sure that the cache is large enough to hold the new values.
    For example, the KV cache could be pre-allocated with the max sequence length, and you can use
    cache_seqlens to keep track of the current sequence lengths of each sequence in the batch.

    Also apply rotary embedding if rotary_cos and rotary_sin are passed in. The key @k will be
    rotated by rotary_cos and rotary_sin at indices cache_seqlens, cache_seqlens + 1, etc.
    If causal or local (i.e., window_size != (-1, -1)), the query @q will be rotated by rotary_cos
    and rotary_sin at indices cache_seqlens, cache_seqlens + 1, etc.
    If not causal and not local, the query @q will be rotated by rotary_cos and rotary_sin at
    indices cache_seqlens only (i.e. we consider all tokens in @q to be at position cache_seqlens).

    See tests/test_flash_attn.py::test_flash_attn_kvcache for examples of how to use this function.

    Supports multi-query and grouped-query attention (MQA/GQA) by passing in KV with fewer heads
    than Q. Note that the number of heads in Q must be divisible by the number of heads in KV.
    For example, if Q has 6 heads and K, V have 2 heads, head 0, 1, 2 of Q will attention to head
    0 of K, V, and head 3, 4, 5 of Q will attention to head 1 of K, V.

    If causal=True, the causal mask is aligned to the bottom right corner of the attention matrix.
    For example, if seqlen_q = 2 and seqlen_k = 5, the causal mask (1 = keep, 0 = masked out) is:
        1 1 1 1 0
        1 1 1 1 1
    If seqlen_q = 5 and seqlen_k = 2, the causal mask is:
        0 0
        0 0
        0 0
        1 0
        1 1
    If the row of the mask is all zero, the output will be zero.

    If window_size != (-1, -1), implements sliding window local attention. Query at position i
    will only attend to keys between
    [i + seqlen_k - seqlen_q - window_size[0], i + seqlen_k - seqlen_q + window_size[1]] inclusive.

            page_block_size must be a multiple of 256.

            or (num_blocks, page_block_size, nheads_k, headdim) if there's a page_table (i.e. paged KV cache)
        k [optional]: (batch_size, seqlen_new, nheads_k, headdim). If not None, we concatenate
            k with k_cache, starting at the indices specified by cache_seqlens.
        v [optional]: (batch_size, seqlen_new, nheads_k, headdim). Similar to k.
        rotary_cos [optional]: (seqlen_ro, rotary_dim / 2). If not None, we apply rotary embedding
            to k and q. Only applicable if k and v are passed in. rotary_dim must be divisible by 16.
        rotary_sin [optional]: (seqlen_ro, rotary_dim / 2). Similar to rotary_cos.
        cache_seqlens: int, or (batch_size,), dtype torch.int32. The sequence lengths of the
            KV cache.
        cache_batch_idx: (batch_size,), dtype torch.int32. The indices used to index into the KV cache.
            If None, we assume that the batch indices are [0, 1, 2, ..., batch_size - 1].
            If the indices are not distinct, and k and v are provided, the values updated in the cache
                 might come from any of the duplicate indices.
        cache_leftpad: (batch_size,), dtype torch.int32. The index that the KV cache starts. If None, assume 0.
        page_table [optional]: (batch_size, max_num_blocks_per_seq), dtype torch.int32.
        softmax_scale: float. The scaling of QK^T before applying softmax.
            Default to 1 / sqrt(headdim).
        causal: bool. Whether to apply causal attention mask (e.g., for auto-regressive modeling).
        window_size: (left, right). If not (-1, -1), implements sliding window local attention.
        softcap: float. Anything > 0 activates softcapping attention.
        rotary_interleaved: bool. Only applicable if rotary_cos and rotary_sin are passed in.
            If True, rotary embedding will combine dimensions 0 & 1, 2 & 3, etc. If False,
            rotary embedding will combine dimensions 0 & rotary_dim / 2, 1 & rotary_dim / 2 + 1
            (i.e. GPT-NeoX style).
        num_splits: int. If > 1, split the key/value into this many chunks along the sequence.
           If num_splits == 1, we don't split the key/value. If num_splits == 0, we use a heuristic
           to automatically determine the number of splits.
           Don't change this unless you know what you are doing.
        return_softmax_lse: bool. Whether to return the logsumexp of the attention scores.

    Return:
        out: (batch_size, seqlen, nheads, headdim).
        softmax_lse [optional, if return_softmax_lse=True]: (batch_size, nheads, seqlen). The
